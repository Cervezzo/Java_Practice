/*
Write a method called wordWrap that accepts a Scanner representing an input file 
as its parameter and outputs each line of the file to the console, word-wrapping 
all lines that are longer than 60 characters. For example, if a line contains 112 
characters, the method should replace it with two lines: one containing the first 
60 characters and another containing the final 52 characters. A line containing 217 
characters should be wrapped into four lines: three of length 60 and a final line 
of length 37.

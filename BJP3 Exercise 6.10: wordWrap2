/*System.out is a variable that stores a reference to an object of type PrintStream. 
  The print and println statements you've been writing are calls on methods that are
  part of the PrintStream class. The variable System.out stores a reference to a special 
  PrintStream object that is tied to the console window. But we can construct other PrintStream 
  objects that send their output to other places. Suppose, for example, that we want to send output 
  to a file called results.txt. We can construct a PrintStream object as follows:
        PrintStream output = new PrintStream(new File("results.txt"));
